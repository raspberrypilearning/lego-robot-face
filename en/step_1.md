## Introduction

Over the course of this project you will construct a robot face from a combination of Lego and electronic components. You'll then make use of an existing machine learning model to help your face recognise different objects and react to them. 

### What you will make

--- no-print ---

Your robot face will be able to recognise and react to a range of objects. Here you can see our example of a robot face.

You should build your robot face using whatever Lego and other materials you have available. We used the [LEGO Spike Prime kit](https://education.lego.com/en-gb/product/spike-prime).
