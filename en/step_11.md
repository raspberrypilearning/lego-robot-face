You have reached the end of the [LEGO BuildHAT](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/name-of-path) path!

If you've completed all the LEGO Spark projects and want to have more fun exploring Python, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python).

You can also bring all your ideas to life in Scratch. Try using Scratch to make more cool stuff! If you need a quick reminder of how it works, you can go to the [Scratch guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch). Or, you can explore our [other Scratch projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch&curriculum%5B%5D=%201) and try them out!
