## What next?

There are lots of ways to extend your Robot face project. You can add more objects that the face can recognise and add more expressions by altering the rotation of the motors, and the images displayed on the LED matrices.

There is also the possibility of adding sound to your project, using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) to play laughs, screams, and sighs when the face recognises different objects.

Or how about taking all you have learned in this path, and creating something original and new!

If you've completed all the LEGO Spark projects and want to have more fun exploring Python, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python).
