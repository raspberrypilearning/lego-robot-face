## What next?

If you are working through the LEGO Build HAT path, then move on to the next project, where you'll create a physical [data dashboard](projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-data-dash).

Or, there are lots of ways to extend your *Robot face* project. You can add more objects that the face can recognise and add more expressions by altering the rotation of the motors, and the images displayed on the LED matrices.

There is also the possibility of adding sound to your project, using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) to play laughs, screams, and sighs when the face recognises different objects.
