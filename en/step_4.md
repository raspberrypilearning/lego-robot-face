## Making a face

This is what your finished model will look like:

Now that you know which objects will trigger which responses, you need to build a robotic face that can be animated to show the different expressions. In this step, we're going to walk you through an example model, but you can adapt the plan depending on what you have available.

## Equipment 
To build this robot face, we used parts from the [SPIKE™ Prime](https://education.lego.com/en-gb/product/spike-prime){:target="_blank"} and [SPIKE™ Expansion](https://education.lego.com/en-gb/products/lego-education-spike-prime-expansion-set/45680){:target="_blank"} sets. However, most of the parts can be found in many existing LEGO sets.

## Building

In the next step, you'll build and connect up your LED arrays for the eyes.
