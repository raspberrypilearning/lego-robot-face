# Making a face

This is what your finished model will look like:

Now that we know which object will trigger which responses we need to build a robotic face to animate them with. In this step we're going to walk through an example model, but you can adapt the plan depending on what you have available.

## Equipment 
To build this robot face we used parts from the [Spike Prime](https://education.lego.com/en-gb/product/spike-prime){:target="_blank"} and [Spike expansion](https://education.lego.com/en-gb/products/lego-education-spike-prime-expansion-set/45680){:target="_blank"} sets. However most of the parts can be found in many existing Lego sets.

## Building
To construct this model or inspire your own, follow our handy building guide

In the next step we'll connect up each component of the face to the Raspberry Pi computer and build hat.
