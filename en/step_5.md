## Connecting it all up

Now that the basic construction of the robot face is complete we need to add the Raspberry Pi Computer and connect our components to it.

### Adding the Raspberry Pi

For this project you'll ideally want to use the BBE element to mount your Raspberry Pi and Build Hat. For the example model a magenta beam was added to the BBE, this means it fits perfectly between the stands of the face.

Mounting the Raspberry Pi this way round enables easy access to the ports as well as the SD card slot.

### Mounting the camera and BuildHAT

Before adding the BuildHAT you'll first need to attach the camera ribbon cable to the Raspberry Pi and thread it through the hole in the build hat:

Line up the BuildHAT making sure all the GPIO pins are covered, then attach the camera to the end of the ribbon cable.

Connect up your small LEGO Spike motors to ports A and B, ready to control the mouth.
