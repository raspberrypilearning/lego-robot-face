## Add the eyes

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">The LED matrices used in the example face connect to the Raspberry Pi <span style="color: #0faeb0">I2C</span>. Devices using I2C are connected using a specific number called an address. As you are using two matrices, each will need its own address. </p>

Before you connect them up, you need to follow the relevant [assembly instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack/0-8-8x8-matrix-assembly){:target="_blank"}. Assembly of the LED arrays requires some soldering, so get permission from an adult before you use any tools. You can follow our soldering guide here.

The matrices used in this project all come with the same address, meaning that for two to work together, one of them needs a new address. For this, some more soldering is needed.

Using your soldering kit, close the `A0` connection of **only one** of your matrices.

Place the eyes into the square sockets on your robot face; use elastic bands to secure them and make sure the pins are at the top.

Now that the basic construction of the robot face is complete, you need to add the Raspberry Pi computer and connect your components to it.
